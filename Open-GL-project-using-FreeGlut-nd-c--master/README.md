The computer graphics (CG) mini project titled “sinking ship” is an easy project that is developed using OpenGL in which a ship will be traveling in the sea. While the ship traveling in the sea in the middle an obstacle will be placed and the ship will hit the obstacle and the ship will sink into the sea.
The objects designed in this project are a ship and an obstacle that looks like a stone. A ship will be traveling in the sea when it reaches some extent an obstacle will appear in the way of the ship and the ship will hit the obstacle and the ship will sink soon into the sea. The controls will be specified and these controls will be provided from the keyboard.

To move the ship into the sea the control will be on the keyboard by pressing any key the ship will start to move in the sea. the obstacle will appear automatically after some time in the way of the ship and the ship will hit the obstacle and sink in the sea soon.
